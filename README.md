# Features
- Can play against another player or AI 
- Keeps count of win count and round
- Basic AI (random moves)
- Displays who won


# Built with
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Description
A Tic-Tac-Toe app. It has a 3 by 3 square. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally). If both players fail to do so, it will result in a draw.

# What I learned
- Module Pattern (IIFE)
- Factory Function
- AI moves (kinda)

# Thoughts
Could've been a lot more efficient with the win conditions and AI. AI is also a little buggy. (Should've used async instead of set timeout.)
